# Snake Boxer Collection

A series of games based on the marginally popular [Snake Boxer](http://www.hrwiki.org/wiki/Snake_Boxer) series in Homestar Runner.

## Available Platforms

These games should be playable on any platform where [Processing](https://processing.org/download) can be installed.

## Q. Why use Processing?

A couple of reasons made Processing an appealing tool to use for building these games with, at least initally:

- Processing is built on top of Java, so it should be fairly portable between different operating systems.
- Easy to build for both the PC and mobile devices using the same code base.
- The ability to port the code base into a proper Java game engine is always possible, since the sketches can be compiled into Java code.
